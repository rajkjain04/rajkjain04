# Hi, I'm Raj 👋

I'm currently a Software Engineer II at [Tripadvisor London](https://www.tripadvisor.com) working on the B2B platforms for [Viator](https://www.viator.com). 
Viator is an online travel agency, owned by Tripadvisor, that offers over 300,000 travel experiences including tours, attractions, excursions and private guides. 

Throughout my career, I have been a Full Stack Engineer and have worked across the stack with various different technologies. 
These are the tools I primarily work with:  

1. **Frontend**: React, Typescript
2. **Backend**: Java
3. **Cloud**: AWS
4. **Infrastructure**: Docker, K8s
5. **Monitoring**: Kibana, ElasticSearch, Grafana, Prometheus

🎓 I recently graduated with a First-Class Honours in MEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering ([EEE](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/)) with Management from [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk/).

⚡️ Outside of work in London, I go to the gym 🏋️‍♂️, train at [Barry's](https://www.barrys.com/) 🏃‍♂️ and watch podcasts 📺. I also enjoy traveling ✈️ and visited 15 places in 2024.
